This page has details related to the original add-on that uses plain web sockets for communication. Currently the OzoneLayer version is the one suggested for real use.

In case browser doesn't natively support WebSockets a flash based fallback is used.

The server side currently supports only Jetty 7.4, but should in later revisions add support for e.g. Glassfish.
