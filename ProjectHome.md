DontPush is a Vaadin add-on that modifies the default XHR based communication with a WebSocket based implementation.

Currently there are two branches of the add-on. The "ozone layer" branch uses [Atmosphere framework](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere) for communication as where the "noname" version uses just plain web sockets. The atmosphere version is currently more actively developed and suggested for end user.

Latest "official" versions can be downloaded via [Vaadin Directory](http://vaadin.com/addon/dontpush-ozonelayer).

See DontpushOzoneLayerAddOn for usage help and DevelopingOzoneLayer if you want to get involved.
