VERSION 0.3.3

2011-10-25 17:05:12

  * Removed use of deprecated method createCommunicationManager in servlet in
    favor of a WebApplicationContext to create SocketCommunicationManager
  * Swapped to use of SLF4J for server-side code since Atmosphere requires
    SLF4J.  This allows developers to now choose the logging framework to use
    in conjunction with SLF4J of which JULI is an option
  * A sub-class of SocketCommunicationManager can be used by specifying an
    init-param to DontPushOzoneServlet with the param-name of
    communicationManagerClass and a param-value of the class name
  * A subclass of BroadcasterVaadinSocket can be used by specifying either an
    init-param to DontPushOzoneServlet with a param-name of socketClass or by
    adding a property element with the name attribute of socketClass as a
    child of the atmosphere-hander element which defines
    AtmosphereDontPushHandler in META-INF/atmosphere.xml. This is useful for
    Spring appliations where you have scoped beans.

    Examples:

        WEB-INF/web.xml:

        <servlet ...>
            <init-param>
                <param-name>socketClass</paramName>
                <param-value>com.foo.bar.MyBroadcasterVaadinSocket</param-name>
            <init-param>
        </servlet>

        META-INF/atmosphere.xml:

        <atmosphere-handler context-root="/bleh" class-name="org.vaadin.dontpush.server.AtmosphereDontPushHandler">
            <property name="heartbeat" value="5000"/>
            <property name="socketClass" value="com.foo.bar.MyBroadcasterVaadinSocket"/>
        </atmosphere-handler>
